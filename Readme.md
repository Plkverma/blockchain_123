# Community Voting Smart Contract

## Vision

The Community Voting project aims to create a decentralized platform that allows community members to create and vote on proposals, promoting collective decision-making and governance. By leveraging blockchain technology, the platform ensures transparency, immutability, and fairness in voting, allowing communities to make well-informed decisions without intermediaries.

## Features

- **Create Proposal**: Users can create proposals with a description, allowing the community to discuss and vote on them.
- **Vote on Proposal**: Community members can cast "yes" or "no" votes on active proposals, directly participating in the decision-making process.
- **Track Voting Results**: The platform tracks the total number of "yes" and "no" votes for each proposal, providing transparency in decision-making.

## Contract Address

- **Network**: Aptos Devnet
- **Contract Address**: `0xbaa7b7adf78854a2bb63271cd0390d39cb72bbdbb36305d657294af0b90f17c0` (Replace with the actual contract address once deployed)

## How It Works

1. **Create Proposal**:
   - Users call the `create_proposal` function to create a new proposal.
   - The function takes a description of the proposal, and the information is stored on the blockchain along with the proposer's address.
2. **Vote on Proposal**:
   - Community members call the `vote` function to cast their vote on a proposal.
   - The function takes the address of the proposer and a boolean (`true` for "yes", `false` for "no") to record the user's vote.

## Future Scope

- **Voting Eligibility**: Introduce a mechanism to ensure that only eligible members (e.g., token holders) can vote on proposals, adding a layer of governance.
- **Proposal Expiry**: Implement a time limit for proposals, after which voting is no longer allowed, ensuring timely decision-making.
- **Quorum Requirements**: Introduce quorum requirements that dictate the minimum number of votes needed for a proposal to be valid.
- **Weighted Voting**: Develop a weighted voting system where users' votes are based on factors like their stake in the community.
- **Result Announcements**: Automatically announce and execute proposal outcomes after the voting period ends, allowing for streamlined implementation.
- **Discussion Section**: Add a discussion section for each proposal, enabling community members to discuss and share their views before voting.

## Getting Started

- Clone this repository and install the necessary dependencies for the Aptos blockchain.
- Deploy the contract using your preferred deployment tool.
- Once deployed, users can create proposals and participate in community voting through the smart contract functions.
